Current todo list:

1. JudgeSubmissionFrame(?) little glitch: Always show submission file type error, but does not affect normal judge procedure.

2. Problem set I sent to Fish this morning: input file path was erroneous, please change that before using or run-time error will occur.

3. Put executive.exe into bin folder.  The current one under judge's folder is fine, it does not produce any bug.

4. K's bug reporting list.  Check your mailbox for detail.

5. Finalize project: Remove or hide all debug messages.  Hide console.

6. Finalize demonstration procedure and slide.
