 + Initial release version.


protocol 0 revision 1 (follow specification 0.2)
released on 2011.05.19   by Infinity
 + protointernal: send_sp(), recv_sp(), shutdown_wr_sp() function.  All functions
 related to send(), recv() and close() will be affected.  Please help report bugs.
 + protointernal: filerecv(), filesend() function.

 * teamproto: Fixed a problem where team clients' were not able to register
 their login_confirm and logout_confirm callback functions.

 * judgeproto: Fixed a problem where judge clients' callback register functions
 were not defined.
 * judgeproto: Fixed a problem where judge clients do not receive message at all.

 + common: Added a notification callback to notify file download completion.
 This applies to all functions involving file receiving.
 * common: Login/logout confirmation code defined.  Refer to
 proto_commondefine.h for their defined names.  Do not use your own definition
 as it might break client-server communication.

 * makefile: Seperated Win32 and Linux into two makefiles and shortened the
 naming scheme.
 * sourcecode: Directory structure altered for easier file management.


protocol 0 revision 2 (follow specification 0.2)
released on 2011.05.21   by Infinity and Fishy
 + common: Now able to test if a socket is listening. (Infinity)

 * judgeproto: Fixed a comment typo.
 * common: Changed some variables named "private" to "private_byte" to prevent
 C++ keywords problem. (Infinity)

 * makefile: Implement CMake auto makefile generation.  The old Makefile.win32
 and Makefile.linux are now deprecated. (Fishy)


protocol 0 revision 3 (follow specification 0.3)
released on 2011.05.28   by Infinity
 + common: Three callbacks are added for server and all clients.  This adds
 the functionality of timer/start/stop to the program.
 + server: Added one callback for programmer to implement password changing
 functionality for all clients.
 + server: Added two callbacks for judge to be able to request run update and
 take run.
 + server&admin: Added three functions respectively for them to set timer,
 start/stop contest.  Admin's set function will send the request to server,
 and server's set function will direct the request to all clients.
 + admin: Added one callback for admin client to receive scoreboard update.
 + judge: Added two callbacks, one for server to notify take result and one
 for server to request clarification.
 + judge: Added two functions, one for run taking and one for clar result.

 * common: Fixed a truck of bugs (serious and not serious ones).
 I won't list them as it  would make the change log messy.
 * common: Improved commenting on header file to help programmer program more
 easily.
 * common: Generalized scoreboard update for admin and team.
 * common: Generalized clarification result for admin and judge.
 * internal: Moved all common requests of client into a separate function in
 protointernal to improve code reusability.

 NOTE: Implementation of global broadcasting is postponed due to some
 definition glitches.


protocol 0 revision 4 (follow specification 0.4)
released on 2011.06.02   by Infinity
 + team: Added three callbacks for team client to be able to receive problem
 set modification from server.
 + server: Added three functions for server to be able to notify team about
 problem set modification.
 + admin&judge: Added one callback for these clients to receive clarification
 reply.  Team client is not affected.

 * team: Changed run_reply and clar_reply callbacks to send essential
 information.
 * server: Changed run_reply and clar_reply functions to send essential
 information.

 back now.

 now be notified the requester account.
 * server&admin&judge: For all problem information and management related

 reuse.
